				<h2>The University</h2>
                    On the first day of July 1921 the University of Dhaka opened its doors to students with Sir P.J. Hartog as the
                    first Vice-Chancellor of the University. The University was set up in a picturesque part of the city known as Ramna on 600
                    acres of land.
                    <br /><br />
                    <div style="width:338px; height:468px; clear:right;  float:left; margin-right:10px;"><img src="https://www.du.ac.bd/assets/img/oporajeobangla.jpg"/></div>
                    The University started its activities with 3 Faculties,12
                    Departments, 60 teachers, 877 students and 3 dormitories
                    (Halls of Residence) for the students. At present the University
                    consists of 13 Faculties, 83 Departments, 12 Institutes, 20 residential halls,
                    3 hostels and more than 56 Research Centres. The
                    number of students and teachers has risen to about 37018
                    and 1992 respectively.
                    <br /><br />
                    
                    The main purpose of the University was to create new areas of knowledge and
                    disseminate this knowledge to the society through its students. Since its inception
                    the University has a distinct character of having distinguished scholars as
                    faculties who have enriched the global pool of knowledge by making notable
                    contributions in the fields of teaching and research.
                    </p>
                    <div style="clear:right;  float:left; margin-right:10px; padding-right:-20px"><img src="https://www.du.ac.bd/assets/img/rsz_aboutuniversity2.jpg" width='380' height="275"/></div>
                    <p align="justify">The high standard of education and research for the University was set by its
                    first Vice-Chancellor, Sir P.J. Hartog when in the 2nd Convocation address he
                    said, "A man may be an excellent teacher of elementary subjects without the
                    power to add to knowledge. But in advanced work I maintain that no one can
                    really teach well unless he has the combination of imagination with critical
                    power which leads to the original production (of knowledge), and for that if for
                    no other reason, a university to be a true university must see that its teachers
                    are men who are also capable of advancing knowledge."</p>
                    <div style="width:400px; height:276px; clear:right;  float:left; margin-right:10px;"><img src="https://www.du.ac.bd/assets/img/rsz_aboutuniversity3.jpg"/></div>
                    <p align="justify">At the beginning a distinctive feature of the University of Dhaka was its non affiliating,
                    residential character like that of the Oxford of England. However,
                    since 1947 the University was given an affiliating mandate in place of an exclusive
                    residential-cum-teaching character.<br /><br />
                    A new phase began in the history of the University with the emergence of the
                    People's Republic of Bangladesh in 1971. This has been a phase of development,
                    expansion and consolidation of earlier gains. The University has assumed
                    a central role in the academic pursuits of the region including this new nation.
                    The University of Dhaka has passed through tumultuous times at different periods
                    of our national history and played vital, at times pioneering, roles in all critical
                    junctures in the making of this great nation. The University played a central
                    role in the Language Movement of 1952 that ultimately culminated in the
                    recognition of Bangla as the State Language. Scores of students, teachers and
                    employees of the University of Dhaka laid down their lives for the independence
                    of the country. Just after the creation of Bangladesh, the government proclaimed
                    the University of Dhaka Order 1973 whereby democratic norms and
                    autonomy became integral features of the institution.<br /><br />
                    <div style="width:213px; height:253px; clear:right;  float:left; margin-right:10px;"><img src="https://www.du.ac.bd/assets/img/ghlangly.jpg"/></div>While serving as the highest echelon of academic excellence, the University also
                    functions as a central premise for free thought and democratic practices that
                    would lead the nation to its march towards progress. The University of Dhaka is
                    increasingly striving to combine the pursuit of knowledge and truth with 
                    the values and needs of an evolving society. It is noteworthy that the
                    Governor of Bengal and the Chancellor of the University of Dacca, Loard
                    Lytton in his speech at the first Convocation of the University on 22
                    February, 1923 said “....this University is Dacca’s greatest possession, and
                    will do more than anything else to increase and spread the fame of Dacca
                    beyond the limits of Bengal or even of India itself”.<br /><br />
                    Presently the University enrolls more than 5,800 students, on merit basis,
                    in the first year Honours Program in different Departments of the
                    Faculties and the Institutes. Besides conducting teaching courses in the 4-
                    year Bachelor and 1-year Masters Programmes, the University also trains
                    up a large number of researchers in different disciplines. More than 1262
                    Ph.D. and 1217 M.Phil. researchers have obtained their degrees from this
                    University.<br /><br />
                    <div style="width:400px; height:261px; clear:right;  float:left; margin-right:10px;"><img src="https://www.du.ac.bd/assets/img/tuniversity4.jpg"/></div>The University of Dhaka is dedicated to the advancement of learning, and
                    is committed to promoting research in all fields of knowledge. As there
                    are plans for further expansion of facilities, plans for new avenues and
                    opportunities, the course curricula are updated
                    and new research projects are undertaken
                    every year. As the pioneer and the largest seat
                    of learning in the country, the University of
                    Dhaka has taken the task to foster the transformation
                    processes of the individual students
                    and the country as a whole through its educational
                    and research facilities keeping up with
                    demands of the day. The University of Dhaka
                    is at this moment one of the leading institutions
                    of higher education in Asia.<br /><br />
                    The University of Dhaka is well prepared to
                    meet the challenges of the future days with its
                    spirit of freedom, justice and truth as a foundation
                    concomitant to the objectives envisaged
                    by the founding fathers.<br /><br />
                    The open-minded character of the University
                    of Dhaka embodying the features of beauty
                    and historical origins can be seen as one
                    enters the campus.
